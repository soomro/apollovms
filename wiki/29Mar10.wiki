==Meeting with Jonas for SAD and SDD==

  * The SAD and SDD are good. We can continue with these SAD and SDD.
  * The presentation of the layers in section Logical view(SAD, section 3) is a little confusing, it is difficult to understand which layer belongs to which tier. It can be presented in more clear way.
  * Some minor problems in SDD had been discovered.
