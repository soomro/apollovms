We have to send the fixed documents to Mattias and in the same email we have to explain about the regular meetings on Thursdays at 10 o'clock.
-We have to book a room before every meeting and inform to Mattias the night before meeting.
-We have to map RUP documents to assigned documents by Gerardo
-Assistants will be in our weekly meetings (But how? I don't remmeber)
-We have to send the link of our documents in svn to Mattias later.
I WILL EXTRACT TASKS AND ASSIGN TO TEAM MEMBERS FROM THESE POINTS.
-We have some reasons to not choose Sahana and Ushahidi:
Hard to use other's code
We don't know php and it will reduce our productivity and quality of work
Sahana which is closer to our solution doesn't have any mobile client
We have enough experienced developers in Java and .net platform.
BUT we will use those platforms as an inspiring source.
-We decided to develop our project in .net and Java
